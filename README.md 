# Shadow Nirikshan Engine

An AI-driven sustainability decision support system that detects invisible
water and electricity waste during inactivity periods.

## Core Idea
Detects "shadow waste" — resource consumption that occurs when no
human activity is expected.

- Scheduled analysis (simulated)
- Explainable decision outputs for administrators
